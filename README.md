## Folder Structure
This folder contains two types of projects, the `MiniProjects` that were the projects done beetween weeks like:
- `ChatServer` - (20/20)
- `FingerTableNetwork` - (20/20)
- `MessageBroker` - (20/20)
- `LoadBalancer` - (20/20)

And the main project `Final Project - P2P Network` that consisted in a network peer-to-peer that solves sudokus in a distributed way - (14/20)

All projects were done with: [João Viegas](https://github.com/joaoviegas11)

There is also the folder `Resumos` that has some theory that I used to study for the exams.
